    "We first sort the list people, in the order of decreasing height. If multiple people are of the same height, sort them in ascending order of the number of people in front of them. For example, if people = [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]], after the line people_sorted = sorted(people, key = lambda x: (-x[0],x[1])), people_sorted = [[7,0], [7,1], [6,1], [5,0], [5,2], [4,4]]. Then for each person [i,j], their index in people_sorted is larger than or equal to j (due to the way we sort people). Hence to obtain the final results, we just need to construct an empty list res, and starting from the left, insert each element [i,j] in people_sorted to position j in res (Latter insertions of [i',j'] won't affect j because either i' < i, or i' == i and j' > j). The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2): We loop over people once, and each insertion is an O(n) operation.\n",
